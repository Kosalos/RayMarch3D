# RayMarch3D
Ray Marching MandelBulb using Swift and Metal

Work in progress.
Experimenting with ray marching algorithm so that you can view the interior of the Mandelbulb.
Using Swift and Metal for IOS.
Demonstrates compute shaders, and using shader to draw a texture for Swift to display.

Image is rendered twice, for 'cross-eyed' 3D viewing.
(With the iPad held two feet away, slightly cross your eyes so that there is a third image in the middle.
Relax your gaze, and concentrate only on that middle image, which is in 3D).
